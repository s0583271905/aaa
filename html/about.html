        The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including
        the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two
        weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
        (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is
        French for Fat Tuesday, but the season actually begins on King’s Day
        (12th Night), January 6th, and extends until midnight before Ash
        Wednesday. Club, or Krewe, balls start soon after, though most are
        extremely private, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old
        families and their courts consisting of the season’s debutantes. Most of
        the high society Krewes do not stage parades. As Fat Tuesday gets
        nearer, the parades start in earnest. Usually there is one major parade
        each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The
        largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the
        Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
        Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some
        of them masquerade balls). The parades in New Orleans are organized by
        social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and
        route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe
        of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of
        Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large
        parades and events (often featuring celebrity guests), such as the Krewe
        of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
        Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
        traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are
        strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw
        cups", and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade
        schedule and route each year. While many tourists center their Carnival
        season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in the
        Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles
        Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter.
        Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and 'tit Rex - also
        take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the
        weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally
        concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.
